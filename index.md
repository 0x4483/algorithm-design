## NP 

Q: What is an independent set problem? 

Q: How can we find the largest k for which G contains an independent set of size k? 

Q: How do we know that all of the problems we have considered so far can be encoded as a single string?

Q: What is a decision problem in nature? 

Q: What is the class P?

Q: Give an example of certificate using independent set decision version problem. 

Q: What is an efficient certification? 

Q: What's the difference between P and NP? 

Q: Give the proof of P is a subset of NP. 

Q: How to show a problem is computationally difficult?

Q: What can you tell when you reduce problem X to problem Y?

Q: What is a vertex cover problem?

Q: Show how vertex cover can be converted to an independent set problem. 

Q: Draw an example of vertex cover along with independent set. 

Q: What is the definition of NP-complete?

Q: If Y is NP-complete and if we can reduce Y to X then X is also NP-Complete. Prove it. 

Q: If A <= B, can we reduce A to B or reduce B to A?

Q: Show the reduction from vertex cover to set cover. 

Q: Which theorems are NP-Complete to our knowledge?
